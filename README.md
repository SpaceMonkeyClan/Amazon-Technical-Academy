# Project Summary

Welcome to 2012! Ahem, I mean to the Kiva team! (Amazon acquired Kiva in 2012) We are going back in time the the introduction of Kiva robots into the Amazon Fulfillment Centers and have plans to one day even have them drive themselves! But let's not get ahead of ourselves...

The Kiva robots are finished and they're incredible! They know how to move forward (F), turn left (L), turn right (R), take (T), and drop (D). What are they lifting and dropping? They are lifting and dropping pods filled with products and carrying them between the pod's storage location and a drop zone, where the Kiva robot remains, and a Fulfillment Center employee removes products from the pod to pack an order. We have created a program that prints out a map showing where the robot currently is, where the pod to pick up is, and where it needs to be dropped off.

We need you to program a Kiva Robot Remote Control! Right now we've programmed the Remote Control to print out the map of the FC and then take in directions from the driver, but those directions aren't being sent to the robot. We need you to interpret the directions and send them to the robot. Kiva Robots are incredibly expensive to make so you need to make sure they won't drive into any walls or obstacles when you make a move.

P.S. We found this incredible video from the future showing “A Day in the Life of a Kiva Robot,” after they learned to drive themselves!
